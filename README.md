# Segmentify Take-Home Project

This project is a take home assignment for my job application. It uses Vanilla Javascript and you can find the other dependencies from the package.json.

## Usage
- Clone the repository.
- Navigate through the cloned folder.
- Run ```npm install``` to get the necessary dependencies.
- Run ```npm run watch``` to compile the files and watch the changes if you want to make it.
- Run ```npm run start``` to run the webpack-dev-server and it'll automatically open a browser tab.
- Enjoy!
